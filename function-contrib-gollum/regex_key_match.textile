h3. Matching Records in a Map Phase with a Regex 

As you can see, this is a simple function written in JavaScript. Its original use was to return keys that match a given regex.

This is the entirety of the function:

```js
function keyMatch(value, arg){ 
  if (value.values[0].data.match(arg)){ 
    return [value.key] 
  }else{
    return []
  }
}
```
