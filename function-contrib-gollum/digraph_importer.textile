h1. Importing an Erlang digraph

[[Source File on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib/blob/master/other/erlang/digraph_importer.erl]] 

This Erlang function allows you to import an Erlang digraph into a bucket. Each vertex corresponds to an object, with the key being assigned the vertex, and the value being assigned the vertex label. Edges are mapped to links on the corresponding object. Edge labels are ignored. A content type is required for the label. If the label contains erlang terms, use a content type of application/x-erlang-binary. 

The function takes 5 arguments:
digraph_importer:import_digraph(address of server, port, bucket, digraph, content-type).

h3. Notes

The function uses the Erlang PBC client, so the correct ip address and port must be specified.

There are currently some restrictions regarding the construction of the digraph:
The vertices should be created with ```erlang 
digraph:add_vertex/2
``` 
or 
```erlang 
digraph:add_vertex/3
``` 
and the edges need to be created with 
```erlang 
digraph:add_edge/5
```  

h3. Examples

A simple example where the vertex labels are json objects:
```erlang
D = digraph:new([cyclic, protected]).
digraph:add_vertex(D, "joe",  "{\\"name\\":\\"Joe\\",  \\"surname\\":\\"Blogs\\"}").
digraph:add_vertex(D, "fred", "{\\"name\\":\\"Fred\\", \\"surname\\":\\"Blogs\\", \\"born\\":\\"3 January 1910\\"}").
digraph:add_edge(D, "son", "joe", "fred").
digraph:add_edge(D, "father", "fred", "joe").

digraph_importer:import_digraph("127.0.0.1", 8082, <<"family">>, D, "application/json").
```

The same example where the vertex labels are erlang terms:
```erlang
D = digraph:new([cyclic, protected]).
digraph:add_vertex(D, "joe", [{name, "Joe"}, {surname, "Blogs"}]).
digraph:add_vertex(D, "fred", [{name, "Fred"}, {surname, "Blogs"}, {born, "3 January 1910"}]).
digraph:add_edge(D, "son", "joe", "fred").
digraph:add_edge(D, "father", "fred", "joe").

digraph_importer:import_digraph("127.0.0.1", 8082, <<"family">>, D, "application/x-erlang-binary").
```
