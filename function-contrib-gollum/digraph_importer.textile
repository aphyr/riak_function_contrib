h1. Importing an Erlang digraph

[[Source File on GitHub|https://github.com/basho/riak_function_contrib/blob/master/other/erlang/digraph_importer.erl]] 

This Erlang function allows you to import an Erlang digraph into a bucket. Each vertex corresponds to an object, with the key being assigned the vertex, and the value being assigned the vertex label. Edges are mapped to links on the corresponding object. Edge labels are ignored.

The function takes 5 arguments:
digraph_importer:import_digraph(address of server, port, bucket, digraph, content-type).

h3. Example
```erlang
M = digraph:new([cyclic, protected]).
```

(...some code to construct digraph...)

```erlang
digraph_importer:import_digraph("127.0.0.1", 8092, <<"my_digraph">>, M, "application/json").
```
