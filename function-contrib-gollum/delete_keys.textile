h1. Reduce Phase to Delete Bucket/Key Pairs 

This Erlang reduce function will delete bucket and key pairs passed to it from a map phase. The result of the function is the number of keys deleted during the reduce phase.

```erlang
-module(reduce_functions).

-export([delete/2]).

%Data is a list of bucket and key pairs
delete(Data, _None) ->
    {ok, C} = riak:local_client(),
    F = fun(BucketKey, Acc) ->
                case BucketKey of
                    [Bucket, Key] ->
                        C:delete(Bucket, Key, 0),
                        Acc + 1;
                    _ ->
                        Acc
                end end,
    lists:foldl(F, 0, Data),
    [length(Data)].
```
